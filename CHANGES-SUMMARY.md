# Game Changes Implementation Summary

## 1. Prestige System Changes

### Changes Made:
- Modified the prestige point calculation to require 1 billion paperclips instead of 1 million
- Changed the reset behavior to not accumulate prestige points between resets
- Added market demand scaling based on prestige level
- Updated all UI text references to the new threshold

### Files Modified:
- `/src/components/game/PrestigePanel.tsx`: Updated threshold references and progress calculation
- Created patch files for changes needed in `gameStore.ts`:
  - `prestige-changes.md`: Documentation of changes
  - `gameStore-prestige.patch`: Specific code changes for implementation

## 2. Quantum Algorithms Upgrade Changes

### Changes Made:
- Modified the `quantumAlgorithms` upgrade to be non-repeatable (only purchasable once)
- Added localStorage persistence for the Quantum Algorithms upgrade
- Implemented proper database saving of the upgrade status

### Files Modified:
- `/src/components/game/OpsUpgradesPanel.tsx`:
  - Changed `repeatable` flag for Quantum Algorithms to `false`
  - Added localStorage handling for tracking the upgrade
  - Updated purchase handler to handle both Distributed Storage and Quantum Algorithms as non-repeatable
- Created `gameStore-quantum-algorithms.patch` for changes needed in `gameStore.ts`:
  - Added 'quantumAlgorithms' to the nonRepeatableUpgrades array

## 3. Console Logging Removal

### Changes Made:
- Removed console logging from various components to reduce lag and improve performance:
  - Removed console.log statements from StockMarketPanel.tsx
  - Removed console.log statements from SpaceStatsPanel.tsx
  - Removed console.log statements from WirePanel.tsx
  - Removed console.log statements from OpsUpgradesPanel.tsx
  - Removed console.log statements from SpaceLaunchPanel.tsx

### Files Modified:
- Multiple component files as listed above
- Created `gameStore-console-logs.patch` with instructions for removing console logs from gameStore.ts

## How to Apply Pending Changes

Some changes could not be directly applied due to file size limitations. For these, you'll need to:

1. Review and apply the changes in `gameStore-prestige.patch` to modify the prestige system
2. Apply the changes in `gameStore-quantum-algorithms.patch` to make Quantum Algorithms non-repeatable
3. Apply the changes in `gameStore-console-logs.patch` to remove all remaining console.log statements

After applying these changes:
1. The prestige system will require 1 billion paperclips for the first point
2. Prestige points will reset after each prestige 
3. Market demand will scale with prestige level
4. Quantum Algorithms will only be purchasable once
5. Console logging will be removed from all files, reducing lag
