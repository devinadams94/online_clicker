// Apply these changes to gameStore.ts

// 1. Find the calculatePrestigePoints function and modify the formula:
calculatePrestigePoints: () => {
  const { paperclips, lifetimePaperclips } = get();
  // Calculate total paperclips (current + lifetime)
  const totalPaperclips = (lifetimePaperclips || 0) + paperclips;
  
  // Points = sqrt(totalPaperclips / 1,000,000,000) - Changed from 1,000,000
  // This means 1 point at 1B, 2 points at 4B, 3 points at 9B, etc.
  const points = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(totalPaperclips / 1000000000));
  
  return Math.max(0, points);
},

// 2. Find the prestigeReset function and modify these parts:
// Change from accumulating points to resetting them
// From: const newPrestigePoints = (state.prestigePoints || 0) + points;
// To:
const newPrestigePoints = points;

// 3. In the same prestigeReset function, find the market demand line and change:
// From: marketDemand: state.marketDemand || 0.05,
// To:
marketDemand: Math.max(0.05, state.marketDemand || 0.05) * (1 + (newPrestigePoints * 0.1)),
