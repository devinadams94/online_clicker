# OPs Production Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the OPs production bonus calculation in the game.

## Changes Made

1. **ResourcesPanel.tsx**:
   - Updated to display the OPs production bonus as `ops/100` instead of using `opsProductionMultiplier`
   - Added CPU contribution to OPs max in the display (`CPU adds {cpuLevel * 50} OPs max`)
   - Fixed the total production multiplier calculation to correctly multiply base multiplier with OPs bonus

2. **gameStore.ts**:
   - Modified `upgradeCPU` function to increase OPs max by 50 per CPU level
   - Updated `upgradeMemory` function to account for CPU level in opsMax calculation
   - Changed OPs production multiplier calculation from `ops/1000` to `ops/100` in the batchedTick function

## How to Apply the Fix

Two methods are provided:

1. **Patch Method**:
   ```
   ./apply-ops-fix.sh
   ```
   This script applies the changes using a patch file.

2. **Direct Method**:
   ```
   ./apply-ops-fix-direct.sh
   ```
   This script makes direct changes to the gameStore.ts file using sed commands.

## Game Logic

- CPU now adds 50 OPs per level to the maximum OPs capacity
- Production multiplier now correctly reflects OPs/100 (e.g., 1650 OPs gives a 16.50x bonus)
- Both ResourcesPanel.tsx and gameStore.ts are updated to ensure consistent behavior

## Verification

After applying the changes, verify that:
- CPU upgrades increase your OPs max capacity
- Your production multiplier increases as your OPs increase (1650 OPs should give a 16.50x bonus)
