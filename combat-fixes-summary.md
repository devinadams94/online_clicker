# Combat System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Battles Won Counter Bug ✅
**Problem**: Battle counter was incrementing even when the player lost battles.

**Root Cause**: The `addHonor()` function always incremented `battlesWon` regardless of battle outcome.

**Solution**:
- Split the functionality into two separate functions:
  - `addHonor()`: Only adds honor and yomi
  - `incrementBattlesWon()`: Only increments battles won counter
- Updated SpaceCombatPanel.tsx to only call these functions when the player actually wins
- Honor is now only awarded on victory, not defeat

### 2. Probe Destruction Too Aggressive ✅
**Problem**: Probes were being destroyed too easily, even with high hazard evasion levels.

**Root Cause**: Multiple issues in the combat system:
- Ineffective hazard protection formula at high levels
- Too high base destruction rates
- Poor scaling for large probe fleets

**Solution**:

#### Improved Hazard Protection Formula:
- **Level 1-9**: 0% to 70% protection (gradual scaling)
- **Level 10-29**: 70% to 98% protection (strong scaling)
- **Level 30+**: 98%+ protection (near-invulnerability)

#### Reduced Base Destruction Rates:
- **Defection rate**: Reduced from 0.1% to 0.01% base
- **Enemy attack rate**: Reduced from 10% to 1% per enemy per tick
- **Probe scaling**: Reduced overcrowding effects significantly
- **Maximum defection**: Capped at 5% instead of 30%

#### Better Large Fleet Handling:
- Reduced probe count scaling factor from 5% per 1000 to 1% per 10000
- Reduced overcrowding multiplier from 0.02 to 0.005
- Much gentler scaling for large fleets

## Files Modified

1. **src/lib/spaceExtension.ts**:
   - Split `addHonor()` and `incrementBattlesWon()` functions
   - Completely rewrote hazard protection formula
   - Reduced all base destruction rates
   - Improved large fleet scaling

2. **src/lib/gameStore.ts**:
   - Added `incrementBattlesWon()` to interface

3. **src/components/game/SpaceCombatPanel.tsx**:
   - Updated to use separate functions for honor and battles won
   - Only awards honor and increments counter on actual victory
   - Fixed import to include new function

## Expected Results

### For Battle Counter:
- Battles won counter now only increases on actual victories
- Defeats no longer increment the counter
- Honor is only awarded for winning battles

### For Probe Survival:
- **Low Hazard Evasion (1-9)**: Gradual improvement in survival
- **Medium Hazard Evasion (10-29)**: Strong protection, noticeable improvement
- **High Hazard Evasion (30+)**: Near-complete protection, very few losses
- **Large Fleets**: Much better survival rates, no more instant destruction
- **1 Million Probes**: Should now survive much better with proper hazard evasion

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with different hazard evasion levels to confirm protection scaling
2. Launch large probe fleets to verify they don't get instantly destroyed
3. Verify battles won counter only increases on victories
4. Test that honor is only awarded for winning battles
