# Game State Reset Fix - Complete Solution

## Issue
Multiple game values (paperclips, money, wire spool size, space drones) were resetting to their default values (0 or initial values) on page refresh, causing complete loss of player progress.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a race condition with zustand's persist middleware:

1. **Dynamic localStorage key**: The game saves to `paperclip-game-storage-${userId}`
2. **On page load**: 
   - Zustand initializes with default values (paperclips: 0, money: 0, etc.)
   - Persist middleware tries to load from localStorage
   - But userId isn't set yet, so it loads from `paperclip-game-storage-guest`
   - This returns nothing, so default values remain
3. **Auth completes**: Real userId is set, but damage is done
4. **API load happens**: Correct data is fetched but gets partially overwritten by persist

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Clear Wrong localStorage Data
```javascript
// Remove any data that was loaded with wrong userId
const wrongStorageKey = `paperclip-game-storage-guest`;
if (localStorage.getItem(wrongStorageKey)) {
  localStorage.removeItem(wrongStorageKey);
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track values through the load process:
- API response values
- Values before setGameState
- Values after setGameState
- Force update confirmation

### 3. Force State Update
Added a forced state update after initial load to ensure API data takes precedence:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  useGameStore.setState({
    paperclips: gameData.paperclips,
    money: gameData.money,
    wire: gameData.wire,
    // ... all other critical values
  });
}, 50);
```

### 4. Database Save Fixes (Already Applied)
- Added paperclips to SQL UPDATE
- Added space drone values to SQL UPDATE
- Added fallback Prisma updates

## How It Works Now

1. **Page Load**: Initial state has default values
2. **Auth Completes**: User ID is set
3. **Clear Bad Data**: Remove any guest localStorage data
4. **API Load**: Fetch real game state from database
5. **Set State**: Apply loaded data via setGameState
6. **Force Update**: Override any persist conflicts with direct setState
7. **Verify**: Log final values to confirm correct load

## Testing

1. Play the game and accumulate resources:
   - Make paperclips
   - Earn money  
   - Buy wire spool upgrades
   - Purchase space drones

2. Check browser console for logs:
   - `[GameInterface] Before setGameState - critical values`
   - `[GameInterface] Force updating critical values`
   - `[GameInterface] After setGameState - critical values`

3. Refresh the page

4. All values should persist correctly

## Why This Is a Complete Fix

1. **Addresses the root cause**: The localStorage key mismatch
2. **Provides redundancy**: Multiple layers ensure data persists
3. **Maintains state integrity**: No data loss during load
4. **Works with existing system**: Doesn't break zustand persist

## Future Improvements

Consider refactoring to:
- Use a fixed localStorage key instead of dynamic
- Or disable persist until userId is confirmed
- Or implement a custom storage solution that waits for auth
