# Prestige System Modifications

## Changes Implemented:

1. **Modified Prestige Point Calculation:**
   - Changed the formula to require 1 billion paperclips instead of 1 million
   - Updated formula: `Math.floor(Math.sqrt(totalPaperclips / 1000000000))`
   - This makes prestige points much more challenging to earn

2. **Updated Prestige Reset Behavior:**
   - Modified the reset function to reset prestige points after each prestige
   - Instead of accumulating points across multiple prestiges, each prestige now starts fresh
   - Players get only the points they earned in the current run

3. **Added Market Demand Bonus:**
   - Added a feature to increase market demand based on prestige level
   - Each prestige point increases market demand by 10%
   - This provides a meaningful progression advantage on each prestige

4. **Updated UI Text References:**
   - Changed all references from "1 million paperclips" to "1 billion paperclips"
   - Updated progress bar calculation to reflect the new threshold

## Files Modified:

1. `/src/components/game/PrestigePanel.tsx`:
   - Updated progress bar calculation
   - Changed alert message text
   - Updated informational text about prestige requirements

2. Created patch files for changes needed in `gameStore.ts`:
   - `gameStore-prestige.patch`: Contains the specific code changes needed
   - `prestige-changes.md`: Documentation of all required changes

## How to Complete Implementation:

Since we couldn't directly edit `gameStore.ts` due to file size limitations, the changes in `gameStore-prestige.patch` need to be manually applied to the actual file. Look for the following functions:

1. `calculatePrestigePoints` - Modify the formula divider from 1,000,000 to 1,000,000,000
2. `prestigeReset` - Change how prestige points are calculated (don't accumulate) and add market demand scaling

## Testing the Changes:

After applying all changes:
1. Verify that prestige points require 1 billion paperclips to earn
2. Confirm that prestige points reset after each prestige (don't accumulate)
3. Check that market demand increases with each prestige level
4. Ensure the UI correctly displays the new thresholds
