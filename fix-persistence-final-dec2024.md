# Final Persistence Fix - December 2024

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed hasLoaded Logic (GameInterface.tsx)
- Removed the hasLoaded check at the beginning of loadGameState
- Added check to only prevent duplicate loads for the same user
- Reset hasLoaded when no session is detected
- This ensures the game loads data when authentication completes

### 2. Fixed Save Endpoint (save/route.ts)
- Removed `premiumUpgrades` field that doesn't exist in database
- Removed `activePlayTime` and `lastDiamondRewardTime` fields from SQL
- Wrapped SQL update in try-catch to continue on errors
- These were causing 500 errors preventing saves

### 3. Added Logging
- Added logging for API load calls
- Added logging for authentication status checks
- This helps debug the load sequence

## Testing Instructions

1. Make some progress in the game (buy upgrades, make paperclips)
2. Check console for save errors - should now succeed
3. Refresh the page
4. Check console for these messages:
   - "[GameInterface] Auth still loading, waiting..."
   - "[GameInterface] Auth successful - User check"  
   - "[GameInterface] Calling /api/game/load..."
   - "[GameInterface] Load response status: 200"
5. Your values should persist

## Root Cause
The main issues were:
1. hasLoaded flag prevented loading after auth completed
2. Save endpoint was trying to save fields that don't exist in database
3. This caused a cascade where data couldn't save or load

## Next Steps
If values still reset to 0:
1. Check browser console for any red errors
2. Look for "[GameInterface] Load response status:" - should be 200
3. Check Network tab for /api/game/load request
4. Run the debug scripts provided earlier
