# State Persistence Fix Summary

## Issue
Values (paperclips, money, wire spool size, space drones) were resetting to 0 on page refresh.

## Root Causes
1. **skipHydration: true** - Prevented Zustand from loading localStorage data on mount
2. **User ID change detection** - Code incorrectly detected null/guest -> real user as a "user change" and reset the game
3. **Race condition** - localStorage was loading with 'guest' key before auth completed

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed skipHydration (gameStore.ts)
```typescript
// Before:
skipHydration: true, // CRITICAL: Don't auto-load from localStorage on mount

// After:
// skipHydration: true, // REMOVED - We want to load from localStorage
```

### 2. Fixed user change detection (GameInterface.tsx)
```typescript
// Before:
if (currentUserId && currentUserId !== session.user.id) {
  // This would trigger on null -> real user ID
  useGameStore.getState().resetGame();
}

// After:
if (currentUserId && currentUserId !== 'guest' && currentUserId !== session.user.id) {
  // Only reset on actual user change, not initial auth
  useGameStore.getState().resetGame();
}
```

### 3. Added manual rehydration trigger (GameInterface.tsx)
```typescript
// After setting userId, trigger rehydration to load correct localStorage data
const persist = (useGameStore as any).persist;
if (persist && persist.rehydrate) {
  console.log('[GameInterface] Triggering rehydration with correct userId');
  await persist.rehydrate();
  
  // Wait a bit for rehydration to complete
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
}
```

### 4. Improved merge logic (gameStore.ts)
- Removed the `isLoading` check that was preventing localStorage merge
- Added better userId mismatch handling
- Improved logging to track merge operations

## Testing
1. Run the verification script in browser console: `verify-state-persistence.js`
2. Make changes to game state
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify values persist correctly

## Expected Behavior
- On page refresh, values should load from localStorage first
- API data should update/override localStorage data if newer
- No reset should occur unless actual user change happens
