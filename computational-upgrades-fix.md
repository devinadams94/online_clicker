# Computational Upgrades Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the high frequency trading and market prediction upgrades.

## High Frequency Trading Fix

The "High Frequency Trading" upgrade was not actually increasing trading bot work speed. The following changes were made to implement this functionality:

1. Added a `highFrequencyTradingLevel` property to the GameState interface to track the level of this upgrade.

2. Modified the `buyOpsUpgrade` function to increment the `highFrequencyTradingLevel` when the user purchases the upgrade:
   ```typescript
   case 'highFrequencyTrading':
     // Count previous purchases to determine effect scaling
     const hftCount = state.unlockedOpsUpgrades.filter(id => id === 'highFrequencyTrading').length;
     // Store the HFT level in state so it can be used in the trading tick function
     updatedState.highFrequencyTradingLevel = (state.highFrequencyTradingLevel || 0) + 1;
     console.log(`[HFT] Upgraded high frequency trading to level ${updatedState.highFrequencyTradingLevel}`);
     break;
   ```

3. Updated the `stockMarketTick` and `batchedTick` functions to use the high frequency trading level to reduce the trading interval:
   ```typescript
   // Calculate ticks needed for a trade interval (base: 600 ticks = 60 seconds)
   // Reduce by 20% for each level of high frequency trading
   const hftLevel = state.highFrequencyTradingLevel || 0;
   // Base of 600, reduced by 20% per HFT level (with a minimum of 100 ticks = 10 seconds)
   const ticksPerTrade = Math.max(100, Math.floor(600 * Math.pow(0.8, hftLevel)));
   ```

4. Modified the `setGameState` function to ensure the `highFrequencyTradingLevel` property has a default value of 0 when a game is loaded:
   ```typescript
   setGameState: (gameState: GameState) => {
     // Ensure highFrequencyTradingLevel has a default value if not present
     if (gameState.highFrequencyTradingLevel === undefined) {
       gameState.highFrequencyTradingLevel = 0;
     }
     return set(() => ({ ...gameState }));
   },
   ```

## Market Prediction Fix

The "Market Prediction" upgrade was already correctly reducing stock market volatility by 20% with each purchase. The function was implemented as follows:

```typescript
case 'marketPrediction':
  // Count previous purchases to determine effect scaling
  const predictionCount = state.unlockedOpsUpgrades.filter(id => id === 'marketPrediction').length;
  // Base effect + 50% more for each previous purchase (0.8 becomes 0.7, 0.6, etc.)
  const volatilityReduction = 0.8 - (predictionCount * 0.1);
  // Ensure we don't go below minimum
  const newVolatility = Math.max(0.05, state.volatility * volatilityReduction);
  
  // Reduce market volatility
  updatedState.volatility = newVolatility;
  break;
```

This implementation properly reduces the global market volatility by 20% (multiplies by 0.8) for the first purchase, and reduces it further with each additional purchase of the upgrade.

## Effect of These Changes

1. **High Frequency Trading**: Each level of this upgrade will reduce the trading interval by 20%, allowing bots to trade more frequently. For example:
   - Level 1: Trades every 48 seconds (down from 60 seconds)
   - Level 2: Trades every 38.4 seconds
   - Level 3: Trades every 30.7 seconds
   - And so on, with a minimum of 10 seconds between trades

2. **Market Prediction**: Each level of this upgrade reduces market volatility by 20%, making stock prices more predictable and less risky:
   - Level 1: Volatility reduced to 80% of base
   - Level 2: Volatility reduced to 70% of base
   - Level 3: Volatility reduced to 60% of base
   - And so on, with a minimum volatility of 5%

Both upgrades now work properly and provide increasing benefits with additional purchases.
