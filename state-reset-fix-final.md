# State Reset Fix - Final Solution

## Problem
Values (paperclips, money, etc.) were briefly showing correct values from API, then resetting to 0.

## Root Cause
The persist middleware's merge function was being called after API data loaded, and it was merging localStorage data (which might have zeros) over the API data.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Enhanced Merge Logic (gameStore.ts)
- Added check to prevent merge if current state has API data and persisted state would reset it
- Added protection against resetting non-zero values to zero
- Added detailed logging to track merge operations

### 2. Skip Auto-Hydration
- Set `skipHydration: true` to prevent automatic localStorage loading on store creation
- Manual rehydration triggered after authentication

### 3. Fixed User Change Detection (GameInterface.tsx)
- Prevented false positive resets when going from null/guest to authenticated user
- Only reset on actual user changes

### 4. API Data Protection
- Added flag to prevent localStorage merge immediately after API load
- Protected critical values during setGameState

### 5. Game State Protection System
- Created gameStateProtection.ts to prevent critical values from being reset
- Protects values for 5 seconds after API load

## Key Code Changes

### gameStore.ts - Merge Function
```typescript
// Don't merge if current state has API data and persisted would reset
const hasApiData = currentState.paperclips > 0 || currentState.money > 0;
const persistedWouldReset = persistedState.paperclips === 0 && persistedState.money === 0;

if (hasApiData && persistedWouldReset) {
  return currentState; // Keep API data
}
```

### GameInterface.tsx - User Change Check
```typescript
// Only reset if real user change, not null/guest -> authenticated
if (currentUserId && currentUserId !== 'guest' && currentUserId !== session.user.id) {
  useGameStore.getState().resetGame();
}
```

## Testing
1. Load the game and make some progress
2. Refresh the page
3. Values should persist without resetting to 0
4. Check console for merge logs to verify correct behavior
